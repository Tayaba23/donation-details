            <p id="header-p">As we all may have heard, Sylhet, Bangladesh is experiencing one of the worst floods in its
                history. Over a hundred thousand people over the 15 sub-districts in Sylhet are badly impacted. Flood
                situation is getting even worse. This happened due to swelling of major rivers caused by continuous rain
                and rush of waters from the rivers.</p>

            <h1>They need us to survive</h1>
            <p>The tragedy of Sylhet began in 1874, when the British created the province of Assam. But Assam had low
                revenue potential, and to make it financially viable, the Raj added to it the entirely-Bengali region of
                Sylhet, rich in natural gas, tea and fisheries. Through the ensuing decades, Sylhetis—both Hindu and
                Muslim—kept demanding a reunion with Bengal.
